<p><strong>Last Updated: June 3, 2025</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how TeamCong (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile applications (collectively, the “Apps”). This policy applies to all mobile applications published by TeamCong.</p>

<h2 id="1-information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use our Apps, such as features utilized, session duration, crash reports, and performance data. This is typically anonymous and aggregated.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFA for advertising purposes, if applicable and consent is obtained), and mobile network information.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> If our Apps serve advertisements, ad networks may collect information to serve personalized ads. This may include your Advertising ID (IDFA/AAID), IP address, and interaction with ads. We use third-party advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob). Please refer to their privacy policies for more details on their data collection practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Information You Provide Voluntarily:</strong> Some Apps may allow you to enter data (e.g., task lists in a to-do app, anniversaries in a tracker, card values in a trading card app). This data is typically stored locally on your device, or if synced via cloud services (like iCloud), it is subject to the terms and privacy policy of that cloud service provider. We do not access this personal data unless explicitly stated for a specific feature and with your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or physical address through our Apps, unless a specific feature clearly requires it and you voluntarily provide it with explicit consent.</p>

<h2 id="2-how-we-use-your-information">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our Apps.</li>
  <li>Understand how users interact with our Apps to enhance user experience.</li>
  <li>Provide customer support.</li>
  <li>Serve advertisements (where applicable).</li>
  <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-information-sharing-and-disclosure">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob), analytics providers, and crash reporting tools. These providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</li>
  <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>
  <li><strong>To Protect Rights:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe it’s necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-advertising">4. Advertising</h2>

<p>Our Apps may display advertisements from third-party ad networks like Google AdMob. These networks may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the ads and our Apps to provide personalized advertising. You can often opt-out of personalized advertising through your device settings (e.g., “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt-out of Ads Personalization” on Android).</p>

<p>For more information on Google AdMob, please see Google’s Privacy &amp; Terms: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

<h2 id="5-data-security">5. Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through our Apps from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free.</p>

<h2 id="6-childrens-privacy">6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>Our Apps are generally not intended for children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if stipulated by local laws). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us.</p>

<p><em>For apps specifically targeted at children (if any), this section would need significant modification to comply with COPPA and similar regulations.</em></p>

<h2 id="7-your-rights">7. Your Rights</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Please contact us if you wish to exercise these rights.</p>

<h2 id="8-changes-to-this-privacy-policy">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the “Last Updated” date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

<h2 id="9-contact-us">9. Contact Us</h2>
