<p><strong>Last Updated: December 19, 2024</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how TeamCong (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of the <strong>Future Baby GenAI</strong> mobile application (the “App”).</p>

<h2 id="1-information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Images You Provide (“Parent Images”):</strong> To use the core functionality of the App, you will need to upload photographs of two individuals (the “Parent Images”). These images may contain facial features and other personal data. We collect these images solely for the purpose of generating an AI child image.</li>
  <li><strong>AI-Generated Images (“Child Images”):</strong> The App generates an image of a speculative child (“Child Image”) based on the Parent Images you provide. We temporarily store these Child Images to allow you to view and download them.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use our App, such as features utilized, session duration, crash reports, and performance data. This is typically anonymous and aggregated.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFA for advertising purposes, if applicable and consent is obtained), and mobile network information.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> If our App serves advertisements, ad networks may collect information to serve personalized ads. This may include your Advertising ID (IDFA/AAID), IP address, and interaction with ads. We use third-party advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob). Please refer to their privacy policies for more details on their data collection practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not knowingly collect other personally identifiable information (PII) like your name or email address through this App unless a specific feature clearly requires it and you voluntarily provide it with explicit consent.</p>

<h2 id="2-how-we-use-your-information">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Generate AI Child Images:</strong> The primary use of Parent Images is to process them through our AI algorithms to create a Child Image.</li>
  <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our App.</li>
  <li>Understand how users interact with our App to enhance user experience.</li>
  <li>Provide customer support.</li>
  <li>Serve advertisements (where applicable).</li>
  <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
  <li><strong>Research and Development (Anonymized/Aggregated):</strong> We may use anonymized or aggregated data derived from Parent Images and Child Images (where no individual can be identified) to improve our AI models and for research purposes. We will not use your identifiable images for training our AI models without your explicit separate consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-information-sharing-and-disclosure">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hugging Face Inc.</strong> - AI processing provider for image generation. Parent images are sent to Hugging Face’s servers for processing and are deleted immediately after processing according to their privacy policy.</li>
      <li>Ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob).</li>
      <li>Analytics providers.</li>
      <li>Crash reporting tools.
These providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are obligated to protect your information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>
  <li><strong>To Protect Rights:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe it’s necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via a prominent notice in the App of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-data-retention-and-deletion">4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Parent Images:</strong> We do not store Parent Images on our own servers. The images you upload are processed through third-party AI service providers (Hugging Face) and are <strong>deleted immediately after processing</strong> according to their data retention policies. <strong>Parent Images are not retained in our systems after the AI generation process is complete.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Child Images:</strong> Generated Child Images are temporarily stored on our servers only to allow you to view and download them. <strong>Child Images are typically deleted from our active servers within 24 hours of generation.</strong> They may persist in backups for a limited period (up to 30 days) before being permanently deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> Our AI image generation utilizes Hugging Face’s inference API. According to Hugging Face’s privacy policy, input data (your parent images) is “deleted immediately after processing” and they do not store sensitive information long-term. However, they may retain system logs for up to 30 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Data:</strong> Usage Data and Device Information may be retained for longer periods for analytics and service improvement, but this data is generally anonymized or aggregated.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can request the deletion of your data by contacting us at <strong>anniversarytrackerteamcong@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="5-data-security">5. Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through our App from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. This includes using encryption for data in transit and at rest where feasible. However, no internet or electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2 id="6-childrens-privacy">6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Users must be at least 18 years old to use this service as per our Terms and Conditions. If we learn that we have collected personal information (especially images) from a child without verifiable parental consent or from an individual not meeting our age requirements, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child, or an underage individual, please contact us.</p>

<h2 id="7-your-rights-especially-for-eea-uk-california-residents">7. Your Rights (Especially for EEA, UK, California Residents)</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The right to access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
  <li>The right to rectify inaccurate personal information.</li>
  <li>The right to request deletion of your personal information (subject to our data retention policies and legal obligations).</li>
  <li>The right to object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
  <li>The right to data portability.</li>
  <li>The right to withdraw consent (where consent is the basis for processing).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact us at <strong>anniversarytrackerteamcong@gmail.com</strong> if you wish to exercise these rights. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h2 id="8-advertising">8. Advertising</h2>

<p>Our App may display advertisements from third-party ad networks like Google AdMob. These networks may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the ads and our App to provide personalized advertising. You can often opt-out of personalized advertising through your device settings (e.g., “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt-out of Ads Personalization” on Android).</p>

<p>For more information on Google AdMob, please see Google’s Privacy &amp; Terms: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

<h2 id="9-changes-to-this-privacy-policy">9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the “Last Updated” date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
