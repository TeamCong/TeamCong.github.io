git push origin main
```

### 2. Critical Updates (10 minutes)

**A. Update `app-ads.txt` with your real AdMob Publisher ID:**
```
# Replace this in app-ads.txt:
google.com, pub-0000000000000000, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0

# With your actual ID:
google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0

5. Save and wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

### 4. Get Real App Store URLs
Your apps currently use placeholder App Store URLs. To get the real ones:

```

**Option B: Manual update:**
1. Visit each app's App Store page
2. Copy the real URLs
3. Update the URLs in `update_portfolio.py`
