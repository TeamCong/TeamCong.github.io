Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the **Future Baby GenAI** mobile application (the "Service" or "App") operated by TeamCong ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

## 1. Use of the App

You agree to use our App only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the App. Prohibited behavior includes:
*   Harassing or causing distress or inconvenience to any other user.
*   Transmitting obscene, offensive, or defamatory content.
*   Disrupting the normal flow of dialogue within our App.
*   **Uploading images for which you do not have the explicit consent of all identifiable individuals depicted in those images, or for which you do not own the rights.**
*   **Using the Service to create content that is harmful, hateful, discriminatory, or exploits, abuses, or endangers minors.**
*   Attempting to reverse engineer, decompile, or discover the source code or underlying algorithms of the AI model.

## 2. AI-Generated Content

The App uses artificial intelligence to generate a speculative image of a child based on the parent images you provide ("Generated Content"). You understand and agree that:
*   **The Generated Content is for entertainment purposes only and is not a prediction or guarantee of any future child's appearance.**
*   The AI algorithms may produce results that are unexpected, inaccurate, or do not resemble either parent.
*   We make no warranties or representations regarding the accuracy, likeness, or quality of the Generated Content.
*   TeamCong is not responsible for any emotional distress or dissatisfaction caused by the Generated Content.

## 3. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding User Content and Generated Content as defined below), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of TeamCong and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of TeamCong.

## 4. User-Provided Content and Generated Content

*   **User-Provided Images ("User Content"):** You are responsible for the images of parents that you upload to the Service ("User Content"), including their legality, reliability, appropriateness, and ensuring you have all necessary rights and consents to upload them. By uploading User Content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, process, store, and modify such User Content solely for the purpose of operating the Service and generating the AI child image for you. **This license terminates once the images are deleted from our systems as described in our Privacy Policy.**
*   **Generated Content:** You retain ownership of the specific AI-generated child images ("Generated Content") that you create using the Service, subject to your compliance with these Terms. However, you grant TeamCong a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, display, and distribute anonymized or aggregated versions of Generated Content for the purposes of improving the Service, research, and marketing, provided that such use does not identify you or any individual depicted.
*   **Representations and Warranties:** You represent and warrant that: (i) the User Content is yours (you own it or have the right to use it, including consent from all identifiable individuals) and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting and processing of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.

You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use this Service. By using this Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are providing images of another individual (e.g., the other parent), you confirm you have their explicit consent and that they also meet this age requirement or you are their legal guardian providing consent on their behalf.

## 6. Advertisements

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

## 12. Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
